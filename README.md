This repository contains projects for Udacity Programming For Data Science Using Python Nanodegree.

Project 1

Overview:

-In this project ,the database is given and student have to run SQL queries required for it.
-Here we have to submit the presentation and queries in a text file.
-we have to create four questions and run its queries ,this quesries should be properly arranged and should be copied to text file and in a presentation slides wehave to show the corresponing visualisation of the results shown by the query and its description.


Project 2

Overview
In this project ,python is used for exploring the data .this project is on bikeshare system which is mainly focussed in three cities i.e washington,newyork,chicago.we have write a code for importing a data and answer the required questions .

Project Submission
The developed CLI program allows the user to explore an US bikeshare system database and retrieve statistics information from the database.

new_york_city.csv
chicago.csv

Requirements
This program was written in Python (version 3.7.1) and relies on the following libraries:
pandas==0.23.4
numpy==1.15.4
